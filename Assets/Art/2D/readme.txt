2D Folder Structure

This 2D folder contains all the 2D visual assets for the project, including sprites, UI elements, and icons.
Folder Descriptions

    /Sprites: Contains all 2D sprites used in the game, such as character sprites, item icons, and environmental textures.
    /UI: Stores all 2D assets related to the user interface, including buttons, backgrounds, and UI icons.
    /Icons: Includes various icons used throughout the game, such as inventory items, status indicators, and skill icons.
    /Backgrounds: Houses background images and tilesets used to create the game's environment and scenery.

Why This Structure is Important

    Efficiency: By separating sprites, UI elements, icons, and backgrounds, artists can quickly locate and manage assets specific to their current task, reducing the time spent searching for files.
    Collaboration: Game designers and UI/UX designers can easily find and integrate the necessary assets into the game without needing to ask the artist for guidance, improving workflow efficiency.
    Consistency: Organizing assets by type ensures a consistent structure, making it easier to maintain and update assets as the project evolves.

Examples

    /UI: UI elements are kept separate to ensure that any changes or updates to the game's interface can be made without affecting in-game sprites, maintaining a clear distinction between functional and decorative elements.
