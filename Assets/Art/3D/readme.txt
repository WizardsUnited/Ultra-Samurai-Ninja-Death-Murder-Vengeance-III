3D Folder Structure

The 3D folder is where all three-dimensional assets for the project are stored, including models, characters, environments, and props.
Folder Descriptions

    /Characters: Contains 3D models of all characters in the game, along with any associated rigging and animations.
    /Environment: Stores all environmental models, including terrain, buildings, and vegetation.
    /Props: Includes smaller 3D models used as interactive or decorative objects within the game.
    /Vehicles: Houses all vehicle models, whether they are player-controlled or part of the environment.

Why This Structure is Important

    Specialization: Separating characters, environments, props, and vehicles allows artists and designers to specialize in their respective areas without overlapping or confusion, ensuring that each type of asset is developed and managed by the right people.
    Optimized Workflow: Game designers can quickly find and implement specific assets, like characters or environmental pieces, without sifting through unrelated files, making level design and prototyping faster and more efficient.
    Version Control: Keeping assets distinct reduces the likelihood of accidental overwrites or edits, as team members are less likely to work on the wrong file or asset type.

Examples

    /Environment: By organizing all environmental models together, level designers can quickly assemble scenes and levels using a coherent set of assets, ensuring visual consistency across the game.
