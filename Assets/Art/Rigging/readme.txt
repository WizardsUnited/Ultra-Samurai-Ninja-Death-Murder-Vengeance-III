Rigging Folder Structure

The Rigging folder contains all assets related to the rigging of 3D models, including skeletons and skinning data necessary for animation.
Folder Descriptions

    /Rigs: Stores rigging setups, including skeletons and control rigs, used to animate characters and other models.
    /Skinning: Includes skinning data that binds 3D models to their rigs, ensuring that they deform correctly during animation.

Why This Structure is Important

    Specialized Management: Rigging and skinning are highly specialized tasks, often handled by specific team members. Keeping these assets separate ensures that riggers can work efficiently without clutter from unrelated assets.
    Animation Consistency: Proper organization of rigs and skinning data ensures that all characters and animated objects use consistent methods, leading to smoother animations and fewer issues during the animation process.
    Cross-Discipline Collaboration: Animators and technical artists can easily access the necessary rigs and skinning data to create or refine animations, without needing to navigate through unrelated models or textures.

Examples

    /Rigs: A rigging artist might set up a control rig for a character here, which animators can then use to create movement animations, ensuring that everyone involved in the process has access to the necessary files in one place.
