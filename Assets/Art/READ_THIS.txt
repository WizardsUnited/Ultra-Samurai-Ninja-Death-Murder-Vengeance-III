READ THIS: Why Design Asset Organization is Non-Negotiable
Listen Up

We’re all wearing the designer hat in this project, which means we all have to pull our weight when it comes to keeping our design assets organized. There’s no room for messing around here—if we don’t stick to a strict organization system, this project will spiral into chaos, and nobody wants that. So let’s be crystal clear: separating Scenes, UI, Prefabs, and Animations into their proper places is not a suggestion. It’s a requirement. Here’s why.
Clarity and Efficiency Are Everything

    Find What You Need—Fast: When assets are dumped all over the place, you waste time. We’re all busy, so why make things harder for ourselves? Keep assets where they belong, and you’ll be able to find what you need in seconds, not minutes.
    Know Where to Put Things: With a clear structure, everyone knows exactly where to save new assets. No more guessing, no more clutter—just a smooth, efficient workflow.

Collaboration Depends on It

    We’re All in This Together: If one person doesn’t follow the organization rules, it screws things up for everyone. Stick to the plan, and we’ll all work faster and smarter.
    Consistency Is Key: We need a unified approach to design. Keeping assets in their designated spots ensures that we’re all building the same game, with no missteps or conflicting designs.

This Project’s Success Hinges on Organization

    Scalability Isn’t Optional: This project will grow, and if we don’t keep things orderly from the start, it’ll become a nightmare to manage. By organizing now, we’re future-proofing our work.
    Chaos Leads to Failure: Let’s be blunt: disorganization is a fast track to a failed project. If we let things slide, we’ll end up with a mess that nobody can navigate, let alone finish.

Bottom Line

This isn’t just about being neat. It’s about survival. Keeping our design assets organized is crucial to making sure this project stays on track and reaches its full potential. If you’re not on board with this, then you’re holding the team back. We’re all here to create something great, and that starts with discipline in how we handle our work. Stick to the system, and let’s get this done right.
