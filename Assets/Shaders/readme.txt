Shaders Folder Structure

The Shaders folder is dedicated to all shader files used for rendering effects, materials, and post-processing.

PLEASE PUT ANY SHADER RELATED CODE HERE. IF A SCRIPT IS NOT CONTAINERISED WELL AND IT COULD BELONG IN EITHER THE 'Code' OR THE 'Shaders' FOLDER THAT IS AN ISSUE*

Folder Descriptions

    /SurfaceShaders: Contains surface shaders that define how materials interact with light.
    /PostProcessing: Stores shaders used in post-processing effects like bloom, color correction, or depth of field.
    /UI: Includes shaders specifically designed for UI elements, allowing for effects like rounded corners or custom transitions.
    /VFX: Holds shaders used in visual effects, often for particle systems or custom effects like distortions.

*Violators will be taken outside and have a meeting about it and decide a sensible solution based on the specific case
